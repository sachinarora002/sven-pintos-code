I took the Operating Systems class at the University of Chicago last quarter.
I build an operating system build on pintos, basicly we implemented a priority scheduler, virtual memory, a filesystem and execution of user programs.
I upload my code to this project and hope it might be useful for other students that have to take this class, who need some ideas to start from.
